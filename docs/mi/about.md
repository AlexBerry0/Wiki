# About

## Who is TÅ«hura Tech?
We are a Greater Wellington based Charitable Trust that aims to provide technology education to students. We are a group of volunteers, teachers and industry professionals who are passionate about technology and want to share that passion with the next generation. We work with schools, community groups and individuals to provide greater access to technology education.

## What is this wiki?
This wiki is a curated collection of resources for technology education. It is a place where teachers, students and anyone else can find resources to help them learn about technology. We have a range of resources, from guides on how to use specific tools, to information on how to get started in technology. We are also working on a collection of resources for teachers and students for NCEA level 1, 2 and 3.
