# Competetitions

Cybersecurity competitions are a great way to learn and practice your skills in a safe and legal environment. These competitions are normally organized by universities, companies, and CTF teams and have a range of challenges suiting different skill levels and interests. Named CTFs (Capture the Flag), each of the challenges in the competition has a mock realistic scenario and a flag that you need to find. The flag is usually a string of characters that you need to submit to the competition's website to get points. The team with the most points at the end of the competition wins.

## CTFs (Jeopardy)

The most common category of CTFs is Jeopardy as these have the most variety of challenges and are the easiest to get started with. Jeopardy CTFs are usually split into categories and each category has a range of challenges. The challenges are usually worth different amounts of points and the team with the most points at the end of the competition wins. The categories are usually:

- Pwnable
- Reverse Engineering
- Web
- Crypto
- Misc
- Forensics

## CTFs (Attack/Defense)

Attack/Defense CTFs are a bit more advanced and are usually only for teams with some experience in CTFs. In these CTFs, the teams are split into two groups, the attackers and the defenders. The attackers try to break into the defenders' servers and steal their flags while the defenders try to stop them. The team with the most flags at the end of the competition wins. These CTFs are normally in person however there are some online ones.
